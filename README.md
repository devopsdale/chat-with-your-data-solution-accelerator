# "Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator  
  
Welcome to the "Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator repository! 

The "Chat with your data" Solution Accelerator is a powerful tool that combines the capabilities of Azure Cognitive Search and GPT language model to create a conversational search experience. The solution accelerator includes ChatGPT model and a search index generated from your data, which can be integrated into a web application to provide users with a natural language interface for search queries.

This repository provides a template for setting up the solution accelerator, along with detailed instructions on how to use and customize it to fit your specific needs.


## When should you use this repo? 

*If you are looking to implement the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern and chat with your enterprise data, Microsoft built-in and recommended product for this is here: [Azure OpenAI Service on your data][../azure/cognitive-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart]. If there is any functionality that you require that is still not available in the product, follow up with [Azure OpenAI Service on your data contact](emailto:wedne_support@microsoft.com) for feedback and to understand your business need.*

In case your setup requires more customization than what is currently available out-of-the-box with [Azure OpenAI Service on your data][../azure/cognitive-services/openai/use-your-data-quickstart], this is the repo for you!

*Have you seen [ChatGPT + Enterprise data with Azure OpenAI and Cognitive Search demo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)? If you would like to play with prompts, understanding RAG pattern different implementation approaches and similar demo tasks, that is your repo!*

If you would like to create a POC [Proof of Concept] and customize to your own business needs and understand best practices, this is the repo for you!

## Development 
### Runnind the solution locally
You can run the full solution locally with the following commands.
It will spin up 3 different docker containers for the:
- Frontend
- Backend
- BatchProcessing

```shell
cd docker
docker compose up
```
### Develop Frontend
#### Running the frontend locally:
- python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- cd frontend
- npm install
- npm run build
- python ./app.py

#### Docker image
```shell
docker build -f docker\WebApp.Dockerfile -t YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:80 YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```

### Develop Backend
#### Running the backend locally:
- cd backend
- python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run Admin.py

#### Docker image
```shell

docker run --env-file .env -p 8081:80 YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```

### Develop Batch processing
#### Running the batch processing
- Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=windows%2Cportal%2Cv2%2Cbash&pivots=programming-language-python)
- cd backend
- func start or Use the [Azure Functions VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)

#### Docker image
```shell
docker build -f docker\Backend.Dockerfile -t YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE .
docker run --env-file .env -p 7071:80 YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
docker push YOUR_DOCKER_REGISTRY/YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE
```
