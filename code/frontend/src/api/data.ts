Bringing Spirit back into the fold could address some of those quality issues as it would give Boeing more control over manufacturing.The preliminary talks were reported earlier on Friday by the Wall Street Journal, which also said that Spirit has hired bankers.Such a move could also help Boeing lower Spirit\'s production costs, a senior industry source told Reuters. Boeing had previously considered repurchasing Spirit AeroSystems, but the optics of buying back at a higher price discouraged such a move, the source said.However, Spirit\'s shares have fallen 70% over the last five years, and its $3.3 billion market value is far short of Boeing\'s $124 billion.\\"Boeing probably realizes that divesting its Wichita operations that make up the core of Spirit AeroSystems was a strategic mistake,\\" Scott Mikus, equity research associate at Melius Research said.Shares of Spirit AeroSystems closed up 15% on Friday in regular trading and were up 2.3% after hours.

Spirit AeroSystems confirmed the discussions.In a related development on Friday, Reuters was the first to report the company told suppliers it was delaying expected increases in plane production as it tries to regain the confidence of the industry and satisfy regulators\' desires for better oversight of its safety and quality control systems.Reuters reported last month that years of decentralization of Boeing\'s planemaking capacity  along with an exodus of experienced workers and aggressive cost-cutting  has affected quality. Two crashes a few years ago dented the confidence of both the public and regulators in Boeing\'s safety record.The first crash, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia, occurred in October 2018 and killed all 189 people aboard. The second crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019 killed 157 people.Boeing spun off Spirit in 2005 and in recent years has struggled with cost pressures and problems that have slowed aircraft deliveries and thinned its balance sheet.

Bringing Spirit back into the fold could address some of those quality issues as it would give Boeing more control over manufacturing.The preliminary talks were reported earlier on Friday by the Wall Street Journal, which also said that Spirit has hired bankers.Such a move could also help Boeing lower Spirit\'s production costs, a senior industry source told Reuters. Boeing had previously considered repurchasing Spirit AeroSystems, but the optics of buying back at a higher price discouraged such a move, the source said.However, Spirit\'s shares have fallen 70% over the last five years, and its $3.3 billion market value is far short of Boeing\'s $124 billion.\\"Boeing probably realizes that divesting its Wichita operations that make up the core of Spirit AeroSystems was a strategic mistake,\\" Scott Mikus, equity research associate at Melius Research said.Shares of Spirit AeroSystems closed up 15% on Friday in regular trading and were up 2.3% after hours. Boeing closed down 1.8% and were flat post market.BOEING AND REGULATORSThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in late January barred Boeing from increasing production of the 737 MAX as it presses for changes.On Feb. 12, FAA head Mike Whitaker visited Boeing\'s Renton, Washington, factory, where the 737 MAX line is produced, and expressed concerns about some things he saw on the tour to CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this week, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.According to Boeing\'s latest 737 supplier master schedule seen by Reuters, the company had to delay plans to increase production from 38 to 42 aircraft per month to June, from the initial target date of February. Boeing has also pushed back subsequent production increases throughout 2024 and 2025.Spirit, one of the industry\'s major manufacturers of large aircraft structures, has struggled with cash flow problems over the past few quarters and quality issues surrounding the fuselages it makes for Boeing\'s 737 narrowbody jets.The company is also exploring selling operations in Ireland that makes wings for the Airbus A220 jet, as it would be unusual for", "id": "doc_c1824ade6fa643fd11d5ceb917f209d06fd1d588", "chunk_id": 2, "title": "/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/", "filepath": "", "url": "[/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/)", "metadata": {"offset": 4505, "source": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/", "markdown_url": "[/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/)", "title": "/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/", "original_url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/", "chunk": 2, "key": "doc_c1824ade6fa643fd11d5ceb917f209d06fd1d588", "filename": ""}}, {"content": "[/documents/MRO Americas - Hand notes  (1).docx](https://str5cmvhl67t5ruq.blob.core.windows.net/documents/MRO%20Americas%20-%20Hand%20notes%20%20%281%29.docx?se=2024-05-02T17%3A15%3A36Z&sp=r&sv=2023-11-03&sr=c&sig=qyJ5lH2MukqpJU06IQbdHWaiD8VeCfeTpz3DXRl0Kug%3D)\\n\\n\\n<h1>The Cutting Edge: Leading the Evolution of GenAI and Predictive Mx</h1>\\n<></>\\n<>(M) Dave Marcontell - McKinsey & Company</>\\n<>(UA) Diana Krohn - United Airlines</>\\n<>(A) Fabrice Villaume - Airbus</>\\n<>(AWN) Lindsay Bjerregaard- Aviation Week Network</>\\n<>(D) Mike McBride - Delta TechOps</>\\n<>(B) Naina Dhareshwar - Boeing Digital Aviation Solutions</>\\n<></>\\n<>Q&A</>\\n<></>\\n<>Q.

U.S. aviation regulators have already curbed production and air carriers have been in discussion for more aircraft deliveries with its bigger rival, Airbus (AIR.PA)New Tab, opens new tab.\\\"We believe that the reintegration of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems' manufacturing operations would further strengthen aviation safety, improve quality and serve the interests of our customers, employees, and shareholders,\\\" Boeing said in a statement on Friday. Spirit AeroSystems confirmed the discussions.In a related development on Friday, Reuters was the first to report the company told suppliers it was delaying expected increases in plane production as it tries to regain the confidence of the industry and satisfy regulators' desires for better oversight of its safety and quality control systems.Reuters reported last month that years of decentralization of Boeing's planemaking capacity  along with an exodus of experienced workers and aggressive cost-cutting  has affected quality. Two crashes a few years ago dented the confidence of both the public and regulators in Boeing's safety record.The first crash, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia, occurred in October 2018 and killed all 189 people aboard. The second crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight in March 2019 killed 157 people.Boeing spun off Spirit in 2005 and in recent years has struggled with cost pressures and problems that have slowed aircraft deliveries and thinned its balance sheet.

Bringing Spirit back into the fold could address some of those quality issues as it would give Boeing more control over manufacturing.The preliminary talks were reported earlier on Friday by the Wall Street Journal, which also said that Spirit has hired bankers.Such a move could also help Boeing lower Spirit's production costs, a senior industry source told Reuters. Boeing had previously considered repurchasing Spirit AeroSystems, but the optics of buying back at a higher price discouraged such a move, the source said.However, Spirit's shares have fallen 70% over the last five years, and its $3.3 billion market value is far short of Boeing's $124 billion.\\\"Boeing probably realizes that divesting its Wichita operations that make up the core of Spirit AeroSystems was a strategic mistake,\\\" Scott Mikus, equity research associate at Melius Research said.Shares of Spirit AeroSystems closed up 15% on Friday in regular trading and were up 2.3% after hours. Boeing closed down 1.8% and were flat post market.BOEING AND REGULATORSThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration in late January barred Boeing from increasing production of the 737 MAX as it presses for changes.On Feb. 12, FAA head Mike Whitaker visited Boeing's Renton, Washington, factory, where the 737 MAX line is produced, and expressed concerns about some things he saw on the tour to CEO Dave Calhoun earlier this week, two people briefed on the matter told Reuters.According to Boeing's latest 737 supplier master schedule seen by Reuters, the company had to delay plans to increase production from 38 to 42 aircraft per month to June, from the initial target date of February. Boeing has also pushed back subsequent production increases throughout 2024 and 2025.Spirit, one of the industry's major manufacturers of large aircraft structures, has struggled with cash flow problems over the past few quarters and quality issues surrounding the fuselages it makes for Boeing's 737 narrowbody jets.The company is also exploring selling operations in Ireland that makes wings for the Airbus A220 jet, as it would be unusual for\", \"id\": \"doc_c1824ade6fa643fd11d5ceb917f209d06fd1d588\", \"chunk_id\": 2, \"title\": \"/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/\", \"filepath\": \"\", \"url\": \"[/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/)\", \"metadata\": {\"offset\": 4505, \"source\": \"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/\", \"markdown_url\": \"[/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/)\", \"title\": \"/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/\", \"original_url\": \"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/\", \"chunk\": 2, \"key\": \"doc_c1824ade6fa643fd11d5ceb917f209d06fd1d588\", \"filename\": \"\"}}, {\"content\": \"[/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/boeing-looks-buy-supplier-spirit-aero-it-delays-jet-production-2024-03-01/)\\n\\n\\nhis previous role, he was part of the team that won the Reuters Jounalist of the Year award under the speed category.EmailTwitterLinkedinRead Nextarticle with galleryDealscategoryLufthansa, ITA to propose further remedies for EU green light to tie-up1:44 PM UTC \\u00b7 Updated  agoDealscategoryPrivate equity owner of Sauer Brands explores sale of condiments maker, sources sayThe private equity owner of Sauer Brands is exploring a sale of the 137-year-old maker of condiments and spices that could value it at more than $1 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. agoBusinesscategoryChevron-target Hess reports Q1 profit beat on higher production12:34 PM UTCDealscategoryKKR to buy $1.64 bln student housing portfolio from Blackstone's REIT1:25 PM UTC \\u00b7 Updated  agoMarketsChevronStocks struggle after Meta moodswings, tepid US GDPMarketscategory \\u00b7 April 25, 2024 \\u00b7 1:46 PM UTC \\u00b7  agoStocks snapped a three-day winning streak on Thursday as disappointing forecasts from Facebook and Instagram owner Meta hammered the tech sector, while FX markets watched Japan's yen sink through 155 per dollar for the first time since 1990.MarketscategoryTSX opens lower as tech stocks drag1:31 PM UTC \\u00b7 Updated  agoMarketscategorySouth African rand little changed before producer inflation data6:34 AM UTCarticle with galleryMarketscategoryEquities mixed as investors eye earnings; yen on intervention watchApril 24, 2024MarketscategoryTSX loses winning streak as railroad shares slideApril 24, 2024Site IndexBrowseWorldBusinessMarketsSustainabilityLegalBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigationsNew Tab, opens new tabSportsScienceLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout ReutersNew Tab, opens new tabCareersNew Tab, opens new tabReuters News AgencyNew Tab, opens new tabBrand Attribution GuidelinesNew Tab, opens new tabReuters LeadershipNew Tab, opens new tabReuters Fact CheckNew Tab, opens new tabReuters Diversity ReportNew Tab, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App (iOS)New Tab, opens new tabDownload the App (Android)New Tab, opens new tabNewslettersNew Tab, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the worlds largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.
